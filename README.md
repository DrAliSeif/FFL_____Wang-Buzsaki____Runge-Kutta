# FFL Wang-Buzsaki Runge-Kutta
Wang-Buzsaki model with Runge-Kutta 4th Order Method for three inhibitory neurons for connect to the FFL

In mathematics, and more specifically in graph theory, a vertex (plural vertices) or node is the fundamental unit of which graphs are formed: an undirected graph consists of a set of vertices and a set of edges (unordered pairs of vertices), while a directed graph consists of a set of vertices and a set of arcs (ordered pairs of vertices).

## Feed Forward Loop
Feed forward loop (FFL) motif is one of the most significant one in both E. coliand yeast. The FFL is composed of a transcription factor X, which regulates a second transcription factor Y. X and Y both bind the regulatory region of target gene Z and jointly modulate its transcription rate. The FFL has three transcription interactions. Each of these can be either positive (activation) or negative (repression). For a three node pattern there exitst 13 possible ways to create a directed (with arrows of definite direction) subgraph.
